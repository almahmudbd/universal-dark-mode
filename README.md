# Universal Dark Mode userscripts

## Overview
Universal Dark Mode offers two styles of dark mode userscripts for enhanced readability across all websites:

1. **Chrome-like Dark Mode**: This script mimics the dark mode experience of Google Chrome, dynamically adjusting colors for a comfortable viewing experience at night. [View on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/512895-universal-dark-mode-2-chrome-like)

2. **Gray-Blue Dark Mode**: A lighter shade dark mode that applies a gray-blue theme, optimizing backgrounds, text, and borders for better contrast and readability. [View on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/512897-universal-dark-mode-3-gray-blue)

## Installation

3. Save the script to activate dark mode.
